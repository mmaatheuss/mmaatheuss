I'm Matheus Santos Lima, I'm 29 years old and I live in Brasilia. Graduated in Systems Development Technician from the Federal Institute of Brasília (IFB), I am currently starting my degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Estácio. Passionate about technology and programming, I seek to learn every day, build knowledge, grow as a person and professional. I share my knowledge through posts and articles about technology through LinkedIn.
